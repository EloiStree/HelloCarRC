# Hello Car RC

> You want to learn the basic of electricity or the code. Why not while having fun with RC cars :) ?


My name is Éloi Strée.   
I tried to hack flying drone toy to have fun with it.   
But it is not as easy as I through...  
But on the way of doing it , I learn to hack small RC cars.   

 
From that fact we can have fun learning with several type of workshop.

The main in my head are:
- Learn how Arduino & Rasperry Pico works in general with the use of relay instead of the classic led.
- Learn the basic of coding with Python or C# in Unity through Serial port and/or HC06 communication to the cars.
- Learn how to control bluetooth smart objects with HC 06 from your XR headset (Lynx, Quest).

If you have any suggestions you want me to create workshop on feel free to contact me on Linked In.
